I am currently a **PhD student** in Computer Science at Heriot-Watt University Malaysia, supervised by <a href='https://johnsee.net/'>Dr. John See</a>. I obtained my B.Sc. degree (First Class Honours) in Statistical Data Science from Heriot-Watt University Malaysia in 2022.

My research interests lie in **deep learning** and **computer vision**, with a focus on multimodal learning and affective computing.

I am currently working on projects in **curriculum learning for missing modalities** in multimodal emotion recognition and **multimodal continual learning**.

**I am actively seeking research internship opportunities in AI research.**
