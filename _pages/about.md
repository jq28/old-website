I am currently a **PhD student** in Computer Science at Heriot-Watt University Malaysia, supervised by <a href='https://researchportal.hw.ac.uk/en/persons/john-see'>Dr. John See</a>. I obtained my B.Sc. degree (First Class Honours) in Statistical Data Science from Heriot-Watt University Malaysia in 2022.

My research interests lie in **computer vision** and **deep learning** with a focus on multimodal emotion recognition, efficient transformers, and data-centric learning approaches.

I am currently working on **curriculum learning for missing modalities** in multimodal emotion recognition and **continual learning approaches** for joint task-modality incremental scenarios.

**I am actively seeking research internship opportunities in multimodal AI and affective computing.**
